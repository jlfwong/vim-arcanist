arcanist.vim
============

Simple wrapper around arcanist for vim. Mostly useful for `:ArcInlines`.

`arc inlines` lists all of the inline comments for the current associated Differential revision.

`:ArcInlines` takes that list and shoves it into the quickfix buffer for quick navigation with `:cnext` and `:cprev`.

Less Animated Explanation
-------------------------

If this is what you see in Phabricator:

![vim-arcanist-0](http://i.imgur.com/EIddn.png)

Then this is what you'll see when you run `arc inlines`.

And this is what you'll see when you run `:ArcInlines` inside of vim.

Which you can then navigate using all the normal quickfix navigation commands. `:help quickfix`, `:help :cn`, `:help :cp`.
