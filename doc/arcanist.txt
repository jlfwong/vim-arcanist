INTRODUCTION                                    *arcanist*

Serves as a link between arcanist <https://github.com/facebook/arcanist>
and vim.

COMMANDS                                        *arcanist-commands*

:Arc [args]             Run an arbitrary arc command. Just runs
                        :!arc [args]. Won't work properly for
                        commands that require an editor to be brought up, like
                        arc diff. When running in GUI vim, --no-ansi will be
                        passed to arc to suppress the ansi color codes that
                        GUI vim doesn't support.

                        :Arc which          Run :!arc which
                        :Arc patch D433     Run :!arc patch D443

                                                *arcanist-:ArcInlines*
:ArcInlines [{revid}]   Run arc inlines and open the results in a quickfix
                        buffer. Navigate between errors with |:cnext| and
                        |:cprev|. If {revid} is passed, then run
                        arc inlines --revision {revid}.

                        :ArcInlines         Shows inlines for current diff
                        :ArcInlines D334    Shows inlines for D334
